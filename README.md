### Introduction 
Rope is a tree-structure that holds text in order to insert into large strings faster than a string. It allows for operations like insertion, deletion, search and random access to be executed faster and much more efficiently in comparison to a traditional String. This Rope can be designed as a B+ tree, which can be very useful to store and modify the strings in file.
